# Gender Pay Gap
This project aimed to examine the Gender Pay Gap by drilling down into industry and positions held within businesses and organizations to better understand where the income gap is most pronounced.

This project first provides some descriptive data analysis regarding the mean, range, and distrubtion of income for different demographic groups. The project then endeavors to run regressions on many of these demographic factors to determine which factors are significant predictors of increased or decreased income.

This project uses data from the National Longitudinal Survey and uses the RMarkdown feature in RStudio to produce an HTML document from the supplied code in the .rmd file.
